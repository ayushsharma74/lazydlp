### Tips for your GitHub Repository:

1. **Screenshots:** Since you used the image tag in your prompt, make sure to actually place a high-quality GIF of the TUI in action right under the title. TUIs sell themselves through visuals.
2. **Badges:** Add a GoReportCard or GitHub Release badge at the top for extra "cred."

**Would you like me to add a section for "Configuration" if you plan on letting users change the default download folder?**
